# hylicPhrasingSystem
I needed an extensible phrasing system that handles conjugation and negation. You can type phrases like "I want to believe", "He wants to believe" by changing only the pronoun section of the chord, and you can even type "I really don't think you should have" all in one go!
I ripped of JadeGG's system (https://github.com/Jade-GG/plover_phrasing) and mangled EPLHREU's symbols system (https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols) to produce this. 


To do:

→Annotate my code

→Finish modal verbs

→Add more verbs

→Implement multichord functions
