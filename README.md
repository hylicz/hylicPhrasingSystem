# hylicPhrasingSystem
I needed an extensible phrasing system that handles conjugation and negation.

I ripped of JadeGG's system (https://github.com/Jade-GG/plover_phrasing) and mangled EPLHREU's symbols system (https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols) to produce this.

To do:
→Annotate my code

→Finish modal verbs

→Add more verbs

→Implement multichord functions


I don't have much of a clue about how Github works, but there we go!
