# hylicPhrasingSystem
This is a phrasing system that handles tense, pronoun, emphasis, and negation. For example "I want to believe" becomes "He wants to believe" just by changing the pronoun you use. You can also negate the 'modal verb' by pressing Asterisk, which makes it "I don't want to believe" or "He doesn't want to believe". Tense works in a similar way, so if you add -D to your chord it becomes "I wanted to believe", "He wanted to believe", "He didn't want to believe", etc. You can add "really" after the pronoun too with #, and each verb array has space for one common trailing word like "to" or "the", so you can get phrases like "I don't think you should have believed that" in one stroke.

It handles both regular and irregular verbs in the simple present, simple past, simple future, and present perfect tenses (which together make up 91.71 percent of phrases in English according to https://ginsengenglish.com/blog/english-verb-tense-frequency), and it's very extensible meaning you can add your own pronouns, modal verbs and their negations, regular and irregular verbs, and you can change what the emphasis word and bonus words are too.

After I'm done I want to add another function that let's you double tap out the chord to change word order "I really don't know"/"I don't really know".

I totally ripped of JadeGG's system (https://github.com/Jade-GG/plover_phrasing) and mangled EPLHREU's symbols system (https://github.com/EPLHREU/emily-symbols) to produce this.
